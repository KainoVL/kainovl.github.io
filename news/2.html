                <h2>We are happy to announce that we have released Kaino version 1.7.5.</h2>
              
                <p>This update is centered around some pretty critical bug and security fixes; Kaino is way more stable and way less vulnerable now than it was a few days ago.</p>
                
                <p>The key improvements in this update really fall into two categories:</p>
              
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>Injection Stability</strong>  This was our first big fix: the update resolves the critical issue that was causing Kaino to crash during the injection process.</li>
                  <li><strong>Vulnerability Mitigation</strong>  We've implemented a series of security patches that address multiple security issues. Overall, we're proud to say that Kaino has a 100% mitigation rate against the vulnerability test we ran.</li>
                  <li><strong>The HWID System</strong> has been completely reworked and is now more reliable and efficient. We have also fixed many issues that affected script execution, which has led to better performance and compatibility.</li>
                </ol>
              
                <p>This update may seem small, but it's a big step forward in Kaino's development. Get ready for our next update, which will be much larger in scope and is being regarded as the next major milestone toward the official release of Kaino.</p>
