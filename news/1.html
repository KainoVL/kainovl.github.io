                <h2>We are pleased to bring you several significant updates about Kaino's development.</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Internal Focus:</strong> After careful deliberation, we have chosen to keep Kaino an internal executor only. Though we explored making an external GUI, we ultimately refocused on Kaino's internal architecture and are refining and enhancing it. (i suck at making guis and im broke)</li>
                    <li><strong>100% <a href="https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard?tab=readme-ov-file">UNC</a>:</strong> Kaino has achieved an 100% score with the Unified Naming Convention (UNC)—not a single script failed. We find this not only gratifying but also necessary given our commitment to standardization and interoperability in the scripting community.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continued progress on <a href="https://roblox.scriptenc.org/">RENC</a>:</strong> With the introduction of Roblox External Naming Convention (RENC)-we have moved beyond our success with the UNC and are now actively implementing the RENC within Kaino. We currently have a 96% success rate on RENC tests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Success enhancements:</strong> We have identified the cause of major vulnerabilities within Kaino and are currently working on fixing them. We promise to bring you the best possible executor we can. We will update you on our progress in the next log.</li>
                </ol>
